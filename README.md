# TOUCAN Ontology (ToCo)  
## IRI: http://purl.org/toco/
An ontology for hybrid telecommunication networks. An Device-Interface-Link (DIL) ontology design pattern is proposed for the first time to our knowledge. Have been published on LOV (Linked Open Vocabulary) with the entry: https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/toco

This development is part of an on-going project which is addressing the convergence of telecommunication networks across multiple technology domains. 
The DIL pattern is observed and summarised through the ontology developing progress. It could describe all kinds of networks. 

Build around the DIL pattern, the ToCo ontology describes the physical infrastructure, quality of channel, services and users in heterogeneous telecommunication networks which span multiple technology domains across the networks. Examples and use cases of ToCo in recent projects are discussed in publications.
